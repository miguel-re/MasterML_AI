# MasterML_AI
Repository that includes all codes of the master from University Tecmilenio.

# Overview

Since January 2024 I started my studies in University Tecmilenio, where I applied for a masters degree as specialist in Artifial Intelligence and Machine Learning MLOps.
I`ve used different tools such as:

- IBM Watson Studio
- Python:
  - LLM Models
  - Supervised and Unsupervised data and models
  - Neural Networks
  - Different libraries such as numpy, sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.
- Jupyter notebooks.
